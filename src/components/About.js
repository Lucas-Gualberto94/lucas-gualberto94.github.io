        <p>I am a front-end developer with master's degree in Physics from the Inter-unit 
          Science Teaching Program at University of São Paulo (PIEC- USP). A fast learner with
          good communication skills. My current passion is to develop websites and pages.
          My journey in programmation started when I did technical course of mechatronics in
          National Service for Industrial Learning (SENAI). There I had contact with C, C++, 
          Assembly and CLP. In my master I worked with data analysis using R language. Nowaday 
          I´ve studied JavaScript using React as a framework.
